Detailed Summary of Fine-Tuning Llama 2
Overview
The document outlines the process of fine-tuning the Llama 2 model using parameter-efficient techniques, specifically QLoRA, to optimize performance while managing resource constraints, particularly in environments like Google Colab.

Key Parameters
QLoRA Configuration:

LoRA Attention Dimension: Set to 64, which determines the size of the low-rank adaptation.

Alpha: Configured to 16, influencing the scaling of the LoRA updates.

Dropout Rate: Maintained at 0.1 to prevent overfitting during training.

Training Setup
The training is designed to be executed in Google Colab, which has limited GPU resources.

The approach leverages parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, allowing for effective model adaptation without the need for extensive computational power.

The model is fine-tuned in 4-bit precision, significantly reducing VRAM usage and enabling the training of larger models on smaller hardware.

Process Steps
Dataset Preparation: Load a preprocessed dataset suitable for the fine-tuning task.

Quantization Configuration: Utilize the bitsandbytes library to set up quantization, which helps in managing memory usage.

Model and Tokenizer Loading: Load the Llama 2 model along with its tokenizer to prepare for training.

Training Parameter Setup: Define the necessary training parameters, including learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.

Training Execution: Initiate the training process, monitoring performance and making adjustments as necessary.
